# Grand Round

### 15 October 2019

## A Case

- 69 year old man
- Ex smoker 3 years, 50 pack year history
- Diagnosis of COPD from primary care
- 3 day history of increasing breathlessness and change in sputum
- pH 7.31, pCO<sub>2</sub> 8.65, pO<sub>2</sub> 7.00 on 24% oxygen

## Acute NIV on ward C8

.center[![plant](./assets/gr-niv/plant.jpg)]

Compared with standard therapy

- Reduction in "need for intubation" from 27% to 15% (p = 0.02)
- Reduction in death from 20% to 10% (p = 0.05)
- More rapid improvement in breathlessness, pH and respiratory rate

---

## 20 years later...

- Median age still around 70
- Median pH 7.27, with some as low as 7.00
- Median pCO<sub>2</sub> 9.9 (~ 1 kPa higher than national figures)

## Obesity hypoventilation

Nearly 30% of our acute NIV caseload is acute decompensations of obesity hypoventilation (compared with approximately 8% nationally).

- Body mass index above 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>
- Daytime hypercapnia (pCO<sub>2</sub> above 6.0 kPa)
- No alternative explanation for the hypoventilation (eg lung disease, kyphoscoliosis, neuromuscular disease, sedatives)

Prevalence may be as high as 20% of those with BMI above 40

## Is that the same as sleep apnoea?

## Hypercapnia and sleep apnoea

.center[![OSA and OHS](./assets/gr-niv/osa_ohs.jpg)]
.center[![Lone OHS](./assets/gr-niv/ohs.jpg)]

---

## OHS treatment

.center[![ATS OHS](./assets/gr-niv/ats_ohs.jpg)]

- Stable ambulatory patients with OHS receive positive airways pressure
  - CPAP first line if co existing OSA
- Patients hospitalized with respiratory failure and suspected of having OHS be discharged with noninvasive ventilation until they undergo outpatient diagnostic procedures and PAP titration in the sleep laboratory (ideally within 2â€“3 mo)

---

## COPD with persistent respiratory failure

.center[![HoT HMV](./assets/gr-niv/hothmv.jpg)]

- Median time to readmission or death with home NIV was 4.3 months compared with 1.4 months in the home oxygen group
- 63% of the home NIV patients readmitted at 12 months (over 80% of the home oxygen patients)
- 12 month mortality ~30% in both groups

---

## So what do we do?

**COPD**

- If persistent hypercapnia post acute event (particularly if previous NIV episodes), offer home NIV trial
  - in or outpatient setup
- End of life discussions and planning

**Obesity**

- NIV acutely
- Inpatient sleep study once acute episode resolved
- Majority discharged on CPAP with either sleep clinic or RAU
- Home NIV first line if little to no OSA component on sleep study

**Kyphoscoliosis, chest wall disease and neuromuscular disease**

- Strongly prefer inpatient initiation of home ventilation at first sign of hypercapnia, even if no acute need for NIV

---

## How do you manage a home ventilator patient acutely?

- Put them on their own machine if at all possible
  - Don't let the relatives take it home / get someone to bring it in
  - Check the mask and tubing for tears
- Controlled oxygen
- Don't feel you have to treat "an exacerbation"
- Get them to a respiratory ward (not necessarily C8 if they can manage their own mask)

**Talk to us before doing anything elective involving sedation**
