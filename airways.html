## A note of caution

.center[<img src="./assets/airways/warning.svg" height="270" width="600">]

This is a run through of approximately my own internal algorithm for airways disease. For "official" or strictly evidenced based approaches see

- COPD
   - [GOLD](http://goldcopd.org/). This [recent review](http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.201701-0218PP) summarises well.
- Asthma
   - [BTS / SIGN](https://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/standards-of-care/guidelines/btssign-british-guideline-on-the-management-of-asthma/)
   - [GINA](http://ginasthma.org/2017-gina-report-global-strategy-for-asthma-management-and-prevention/)
- Bronchiectasis
   - [BTS](https://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/standards-of-care/guidelines/bts-guideline-for-non-cf-bronchiectasis/)

## Spirometry refresher

#### Measurement of lung physiology not diagnostic per se

*"Take a deep breath in and blow out as hard as you can, for as long as you can"*

.center[![Normal spirometry](./assets/airways/spiro.png)]

---

## Spirometry parameters

.center[![FEV1](./assets/airways/fev1fvc.png)]

- FEV<sub>1</sub> "how quickly can you breathe out"
- FVC "how much can you breathe out"

---

## Spirometry patterns - obstruction

## Airways clinic

.center[![Breathlessness](./assets/airways/airways.svg)]

---

## Asthma or COPD?

.center[![Asthma or COPD](./assets/airways/airways1.svg)]

---

## Investigation of suspected airways disease

Aim to exclude other conditions (heart failure, anaemia, etc, etc) and to categorise the clinical phenotype.

#### For everyone

- **History** and examination
- FBC (and maybe IgE, F<sub>E</sub>NO)
- Spirometry
- Chest X-ray
- Pulse oximetry

---

## Investigation of suspected airways disease

#### Selected patients

- [Peak flow diary](https://www.asthma.org.uk/globalassets/health-advice/resources/adults/your_peak_flow_diary.pdf) but not always easy to interpret
- Sputum cultures if exacerbations or significant amounts of sputum
- Low dose CT thorax - an ever lower threshold for this, particularly if sputum (bronchiectasis?), barking cough ([excessive central airways collapse](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16771908)?) or trivial smoking history (obliterative bronchiolitis?)
   - do it once, no need to repeat
   - beware of [nodules](https://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/document-library/clinical-information/pulmonary-nodules/bts-guidelines-for-pulmonary-nodules/), their follow up can take up much time and generate significant anxiety.
- Full PFTs if symptoms out of proportion to airflow obstruction
- [Oasys diary](http://www.occupationalasthma.com/) if occupational history
- Overnight oximetry if fat and fatigued

(&alpha;<sub>1</sub> antitrypsin, echocardiography, exercise tolerance tests, etc)

---

## Asthma?

A label of predominantly(?) *asthma* may be appropriate if there is

- History of atopy
- Eosinophilia on blood counts
- Raised IgE
- Raised F<sub>E</sub>NO
- Clinically meaningful reversibility in the spirometry [12% and 200ml](http://goldcopd.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GOLD_Spirometry_2010.pdf)?, [400ml](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG101/chapter/1-Guidance#diagnosing-copd)?, [something else](https://www.pftforum.com/blog/the-8-percent-solution/)?

---

## Occupational asthma

.center[![Positive oasys diary](./assets/airways/oasys.jpg)]

- "What do you do?"
- "Is your chest better away from work?"

Several [occupations](http://www.hse.gov.uk/asthma/) have a high risk of occupational asthma.

---

## Asthma treatment

#### See [BTS / SIGN](https://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/standards-of-care/guidelines/btssign-british-guideline-on-the-management-of-asthma/)

.left-column[1. Start an inhaled steroid early
2. Combination ICS / LA&beta;A
3. Crank up the ICS dose
4. Adjuncts, particularly montelukast
5. Get help from secondary care
   - Confirm diagnosis
   - Small print stuff ([Omalizumab](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta278/chapter/1-Guidance), [Mepolizumab](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA431/chapter/1-Recommendations), antifungals, thermoplasty, etc)
]

.right-column[- Smoking cessation
- Aggrevating factors (pets, hobbies, jobs)
- Treat alternate or co-existing diagnoses
   - Hayfever
   - Gastroesophageal reflux
   - [Dysfunctional breathing](http://err.ersjournals.com/content/25/141/287.long)
   - [Vocal cord dysfunction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27575803)
- Check and recheck drug adherence
]
---

## COPD?

.center[![Smoking related chest disease](./assets/airways/copd.svg)]

Traditionally chronic airflow limitation that is not completely reversible, generally but not exclusively related to smoking.

This label covers a broad range of clinical phenotypes. It can end up as a diagnosis of convenience, inhibiting thought.

---

## Treatment of COPD

#### Everyone

- Smoking cessation
- Pulmonary rehabilitation and / or encourage exercise
- Wellbeing, attend to associated anxiety, etc

---

## Airflow limitation

#### "Textbook COPD"

.left-column[
![Obstructed spirometry](./assets/airways/fv.png)

]

.right-column[
- SA&beta;A
- LAMA
- LA&beta;A
- (Inhaled steroid only if exacerbations or eosinophilia)
- (Short trial of aminophylline but don't persevere if patient doesn't report symptomatic benefit)

Don't let a focus on pharmacology distract from the far more important smoking cessation and pulmonary rehabilitation.
]

---

## Chronic bronchitis

#### Cough and mucus but perhaps [normal spirometry](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1505971#t=article)

- Sputum cultures and treat as appropriate. Reasonable to be aggressive with antibiotics at first presentation but
   - Don't mistake colonisation for infection
   - Be realistic about goals - chronic sputum production is not going to resolve entirely with antibiotics
   - Don't give repeated courses of antibiotics without a good reason
- Consider inhaled steroid, particularly if there are other asthma pointers
- Use mucolytics liberally. Carbocisteine and nebulised hypertonic saline are on the [local formulary](http://www.elmmb.nhs.uk/elmmb-formulary/joint-medicines-formulary/3/). The evidence base for this advice is poor but my personal view is that without these drugs many patients will end up being given repeated courses of antibiotics and / or oral steroid.
- Encourage [active cycle of breathing techniques](http://www.acprc.org.uk/Data/Publication_Downloads/GL-05ACBT.pdf)
- Consider [immune testing](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2006.03138.x/full)
- (Long term low dose macrolides)
- (Nebulised antibiotics for difficult colonising organisms such as pseudomonas)

---

## Emphysema

#### Destruction of lung parenchyma visible on CXR or CT with low TL<sub>CO</sub> (if measured)

.left-column[![Emphysema CT](./assets/airways/Emphysema.jpg)]

.right-column[- Limited easy treatment options here
- Pulse oximetry +/- 6 minute walk, then LTOT assessment and or ambulatory oxygen <a href="https://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/document-library/clinical-information/oxygen/home-oxygen-guideline-(adults)/bts-guidelines-for-home-oxygen-use-in-adults/">if appropriate</a>
- (Bullectomy if significant functional impairment and single large bulla)
- (Lung volume reduction in small group of carefully selected patients with heterogenous disease and otherwise optimised (pulmonary rehabilitation, smoking cessation, etc))
- (Lung transplant assessment)]

---

## Hypercapnic respiratory failure

#### Persistently high carbon dioxide levels

Home nocturnal non invasive ventilation is [increasingly an option](http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/48/suppl_60/OA3527) for patients with raised pCO<sub>2</sub> when stable, particularly if there is significant obesity and / or acute presentations with decompensated type 2 respiratory failure.

.left-column[![Ventilator bag](./assets/airways/vent_bag.jpg)]
.right-column[![Ventilator](./assets/airways/vent.jpg)]


---

## Palliation

#### Symptomatic treatments as end of life approaches

- Opiates have a special role in the treatment of dyspnoea. Decreasing respiratory rate may improve expiratory time and improve lung mechanics in addition to the anxiolytic etc effects.
- Hospice and community services
- (Nebulised short acting bronchodilators - perhaps an option for ["distressing or disabling breathlessness despite maximal therapy using inhalers"](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG101/chapter/1-Guidance#managing-stable-copd). Cardiac arrhythmia and [tachyphylaxis](http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2012.185.1_MeetingAbstracts.A3955) make nebulised SA&beta;As in particular unattractive earlier in the disease process.)
- (Low dose oral prednisolone - long term oral steroids are specifically [**not recommended**](http://goldcopd.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wms-At-A-Glance-2017-FINAL.pdf) in the latest GOLD guidelines due to high rates of systemic complications and little evidence of benefit. Occasionally keeping a severely disabled patient on a low dose of prednisolone can be pragmatically justified if the alternative is them obtaining effectively continuous "short courses" from out of hours services. Preventing such psychological dependence on steroid in the first place would be better, of course)

---

## Exacerbations

Defined by

- Increased breathlessness
- Increased sputum volume
- Increased sputum purulence

Inhaled SA&beta;A for mild exacerbations, oral steroid and / or antibiotic and / or *short term* nebulised bronchodilators and / or hospitalisation for moderate to severe exacerbations.

From GOLD again: *"Duration of [systemic corticosteroids] should not be more than 5-7 days"*

The following are **not** exacerbations of COPD and should **not** be treated with steroids or antibiotics:-

- Depression
- Anxiety
- Deconditioning

Beware the "rescue pack" abuser - oral prednisolone every month is **far, far too often**

---

## COPD - Who to refer to secondary care

#### Consider referring to chest clinic if

- Diagnosis is unclear
- Breathlessness is out of proportion to spirometry
- Current occupation associated with [occupational asthma](http://www.hse.gov.uk/asthma/)
- Before labelling relatively young people (perhaps < 50 or so) or those with little smoking history as having COPD
- There's a second interacting diagnosis, especially breathing pattern disorders
- To assess suitability for complex interventions - home ventilation, lung volume reduction, lung transplantation
- Complex microbiology, eg pseudomonas colonisation

.right-column[- [Confusing terminology](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1204664?af=R&rss=currentIssue)

- Supportive treatment
- Macrolides?
